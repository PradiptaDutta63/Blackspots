# Blackspots
With the increasing number of accidents, it is very important to look for factors leading to Blackspots. 
The csv file contains the features that might lead to Blackspot. Our job is to look for leading contributors and build a Machine Learning model that can predict the risks of Blackspot.
The data is taken from Department of Transport and demographics data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

## Using EDA we will get insights from the dataset and select the prime features and build a ML model.
